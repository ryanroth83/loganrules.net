Reference all URLs to your root that starts at the static folder like we talked about. Look at what I changed in rocktopus.

Do not change any of the files in the themes directory, if you wanna change something that is in the theme. You can copy it modify it and put it in the route directory tree. Hugo will use the files on the route first if there's nothing there, then it will default into the theme version.

Do not use spaces and file names use underscores or dashes. That was what was giving you trouble in the 3-D printing section. There's also some scripting errors I had to use chatGPT to figure them out.

I converted config to YAML.. LMK if you like it better.

IDK whats going on with the 3D printing section. I'm not familiar with this theme.. yet... 

Theres some more cleanup I can do with the files you dont need once we get some more figured out..
